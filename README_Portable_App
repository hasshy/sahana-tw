Sahana PortableApp - ReadMe
===========================

Sahana is a free and open source Disaster Management System.It mainly facilitates management of Missing people, disaster victims, Managing and administrating various organisations, managing camps and managing requests and assistance in the proper distribution of resources.


Installing to Hard disk
-----------------------

You can run Sahana from the moment you unzip the PortableApp archive, without needing to setup a webserver, database or PHP. Just run sahana.exe to lauch the Sahana portable menu. However if you would like a shortcut on your desktop and the copying of files to another location use the install.exe.

Installing to a USB
-------------------

The PortableApp version of Sahana can be run from a USB 2.0 disk. To install it to the USB simply unzip the archive to the root (base drive) of the USB disk. 

Configuring the PortableApp version
-----------------------------------

When you first get the PortableApp version of Sahana, you will need to configure Sahana and the WAMP server. To configure follow the following steps

(1) Install Sahana to a suitable location as above

(2) Launch the Sahana portable by running sahana.exe. 

(3) Click on the appropriate menu item to launch 'Sahana in your Default Browser' or in the 'Firefox Portable'.
(4) Also configure your WAMP (Web Server and Database) installation by clicking on the 'Uniform Server Admin'. Especially check the 'Security Console' to ensure the installation is secured.

Note : You do not have to configure the database since it is already configured.

Trouble shooting
----------------
Check if the WebServer (Apache) and Database (MySQL) has started by clicking on the 'Check Server Ports' menu items. You should see a report as below indicating port 80 and port 3306 is taken by programs Apache.exe and mysqld-opt.exe from the W: drive

Apache (HTTP)          80   w:\usr\local\apache2\bin\Apache.exe
Apache (WebDAV)        81   free
Apache (HTTPS)        443   free

MySQL                3306   W:\usr\local\mysql\bin\mysqld-opt.exe

If you don't see the above click on 'Stop Sahana Server' followed by 'Re-Start Sahana Server'. If instead the above ports are taken by another program you need to stop that program before Sahana works. This could be another installation of Apache or MySQL that is creating the conflict. 


PortableApp version - 0.6.2.2-stable
